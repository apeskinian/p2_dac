                <h2>Welcome, Dragonlords and Ladies!</h2>
                <p>Prepare to soar on dragonback through the tangled family trees of House Targaryen and their allies
                    (and enemies!). This quiz will test your knowledge of the fiery, intricate relationships that ignite
                    the world of "House of the Dragon." Whether you're a Maester of lore or just a fledgling scribe,
                    each question is a chance to prove your worth. But beware, amidst the politics and lineage, there's
                    always room for a little whimsyâ€”remember, sometimes dragons are just cool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enjoy the quiz and may your answers be as sharp as Valyrian steel!
